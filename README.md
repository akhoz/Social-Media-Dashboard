# Social Media Dashboard
With this project, I aim to enhance my frontend skills and further progress in my 
learning journey with React. I'm exploring new aspects such as theme switch toggle 
buttons and more to broaden my understanding. Additionally, this project marks my 
initial attempt at integrating a frontend with a backend, adding an exciting layer 
to my learning experience.

## General information
This project originates from an idea I found on the 
[Frontend Mentor website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). All icons, 
colors, and the general project structure were downloaded from their site, 
and they hold all the rights. I appreciate this approach as it provides a 
well-defined design for implementation, aligning with my belief in effective 
collaboration between designers and developers.
